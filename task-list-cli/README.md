# About Task List CLI

This example defines a simple task list CLI that allows users to add and remove tasks. The tasks are stored in a file (tasks.txt), and the program loads them on startup. The user can then interactively add, remove, or quit the application.

# Additional Features
Here are some additional features you might consider adding to your task list CLI in Go to make it more robust and user-friendly:

4. **Task Details:**

7. **Undo/Redo Operations:**
