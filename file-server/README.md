# Breakdown

-`http.FileServer` creates an HTTP handler that serves files from a specified directory.

-`http.StripPrefix` is used to strip a prefix ("/files/") from the request URL path before passing it to the file server handler. This helps create cleaner URLs.

-The file server handler is registered with a specific route ("/files/") using `http.Handle`.

-A basic root handler is registered with http.HandleFunc to handle requests to the root path ("/").

-The server is started using `http.ListenAndServe` on port 8080.

-You can access the file server at http://localhost:8080. Files in the "./files" directory can be accessed by appending their relative paths to the base URL, like http://localhost:8080/files/example.txt. Make sure to replace "./files" with the actual path to the directory you want to serve.
